rtl-sdr (0.6.0-5.1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  In this version, librtlsdr0 has moved its udev rules file from /lib
  to /usr/lib. If this package is back-ported to a release prior to
  trixie this change must be revertedm, otherwise the dpkg-divert calls
  in the maintainer scripts will cause breakage (dh_movetousr is a
  no-op pre-trixie).
